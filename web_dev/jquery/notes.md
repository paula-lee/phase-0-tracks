Release 0: Make a Plan

1. First get a better understanding of the functionality, what it does, what programs can it work with, and specialties.
2. Look up any cheat sheets, references, common questions.
3. Find any tutorials on youtube or sites, and go over the best ones out of the ones found. There are probably a ton of sites but you just have to find the right one that works for you. 
4. You should stop and test once you feel you have a good understanding of the fundamentals and try on your own. 
5. Breaks are very important, especially when learning a new
language. 

Release 1: Study Up
1. Videos and examples were very helpful! I learn a lot better when I see visual examples.
Especially seeing how some of the attributes, selectors, events, etc. work.
2. Took a lot of breaks, maybe even too many breaks.
3. I should have tested more.
