RELEASE 1 QUESTIONS:

2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
	Small is beautiful - smaller things have advantages; used to combine 	with other small things to be useful
	Make each program do one thing well - get rid of unnecessary overhead,
		complexity, and no flexibility
	Build a prototype ASAP - give the user something, anything
	Choose portability over efficiency - able to run on a new hardware with
		minimal effort

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	VPS has the same functionality of a computer, without it being an 		actual computer and has its' own operating system.

4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	Mistakes are more likely to happen and/or bugs. Could delete everything
		in the system.
	Are vulnerable to harmful software and hacks because you gave full
		permissions.
	Ran rm -rf *.
	It is best practice to run your application at a user level and do
		administrative tasks at the root user level.



RELEASE 2: EXPLORE THE DOM
inner-text: change some of the titles or content from the page
lang: maybe I want to practice my spanish and convert it
contentedible: what if it wasn't inheritable? Would like to know
	what happens and make it false instead.
nodeType: can specify a type of node by using 1, 2, 3, or 8; is read-only
outer-text: similar to inner-text but instead of just replacing the 
	content inside the tags, outer-text replaces the content AND the
	tags.
