# pseudocode
# create a method called encrypt_name that can take first and last name
# take the first and last name and make into an array
	# separate the first and last name by splitting it so that first name is a value
	# and last name is a value
	# assign the split full name into a variable name called split_name
# call .reverse on the split_name array so that it will swap the first name and the last name 
	# originally thought of doing array[0], array[1] = array[1], array[0] to swap but found 
	# .reverse is shorter and cleaner
# create a new variable called swapped_name and assign it to the new swapped name
# create a method called vowel
	# define the vowels 
	# if there is a space " ", leave it alone
	# if full_name includes vowels, then return the next vowel letter
	# if the vowel is "u", make it an "a"
# create a method called consonant
	# define the consonants
	# if there is a space " ", leave it alone
	# if the full_name includes consonants, then return the next consonant letter
	# if the vowel is "z", make it an "b"
