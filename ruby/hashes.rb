	#client's name (string)
	#age (integer)
	#number of children (integer)
	#decor theme (string)
	#has pets (boolean)
	#wants plants (boolean)
#convert input to string, boolean, or integer
#print out the hash
#ask the user if there is anything they would like to change (no loop)
	#if none, skip
	#else if user types the key name, prompt for a new value
	#update the user input from string to symbol then update the key to the new value
#print latest version of hash
